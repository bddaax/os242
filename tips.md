# TIPS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION

## **Welcome, Future OS Participants!**
Here are some valuable tips to help you navigate your journey through the OS course successfully. Avoid the mistakes we made, and embrace these lessons to shine!

---

### **1️⃣ TIP #1: Respect Deadlines!**
Pop quizzes are important! Make sure to complete them **before 18:00 on the deadline day**.  
⚠️ **Note:** The deadline is at 18:00, **not 23:59**. Plan accordingly and don’t leave things to the last minute.

---

### **2️⃣ TIP #2: Follow Instructions!**
The instructions are there for a reason. **Do not skip steps** or try things you don’t understand fully. Missing a single step can derail your entire project.  
When in doubt, **read and understand** before proceeding.

---

### **3️⃣ TIP #3: Weekly Quizzes on Friday**
Weekly quizzes start at **18:40**, not 19:00.  
Be on Zoom **10 minutes early** to avoid last-minute stress. Preparation and punctuality go a long way!

---

### **4️⃣ TIP #4: Don’t Copy-Paste Blindly**
When working on assignments, always **read and understand** the instructions before executing commands. Copy-pasting blindly without comprehension can lead to errors and wasted time.  
Remember, you’re learning to think critically, not just replicate steps!

---

### **5️⃣ TIP #5: Take Assignments and Quizzes Seriously**
Assignments and pop quizzes are not just tasks—they’re opportunities to learn and grow. Ignoring them may land you in the **ATTN Forum**, and trust us, you don’t want to be there.

### **Final Note**
This course is as much about discipline as it is about technical skills. Stay curious, stay diligent, and always aim for excellence. Good luck, and enjoy the journey!
