  * [Linux Crash Course - Easy Terminal Commands for Inspecting Hardware](https://youtu.be/oGyJr-iUwt8?si=59V2boc0XfmlFekg)  
    Some easy-to-use commands you can use to inspect hardware. These commands will help you list PCI devices, view information about your CPU, and more.
  * [SHA-256 Algorithm](https://www.n-able.com/blog/sha-256-encryption)
    SHA-256(Secure Hash Algorithm) is an encryption algorithm used to secure data. While talking about security, hashing means converting data into a secure format, so that no one could access the data unless they have the key. 256 in SHA-256 means 256-bits long; or we can say that every data that is encrypted with SHA-256 hashing will be transformed into 256-bits string.
  * [Public Key and Private Key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4HQ8Bp-pfw)
    Public key and Private key are key pairs that are used for asymmetric encryption and decryption process. So when the private key encrypts data, the public key is used to decrypt the data. This is one of the reasons why the private key cannot be given to just anyone.

  * [Cyber Security Full Course for Beginner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_P23SqJaDc&feature=youtu.be&themeRefresh=1)  
    You should watch the first 30 seconds of chapters 2 to 30. For the chapter time stamp, see the comments section.
  * [What is TAR file?](https://www.lifewire.com/tar-file-2622386)
    The TAR file format is common in Linux and Unix systems, but only for storing data, not compressing it. This website is interesting because through reading it weâ€™ll be able to understand the definition of TAR file, how to make them, and how to convert them.

  * [Introduction to Memory](https://youtu.be/PujjqfUhtNo?si=r3r_b7WXWJyNYwze)  
    To recall the material about Memory.  
  * [How computer memory works](https://youtu.be/p3q5zWCw8J4?si=HNAJ8R4RLLgWepJz)  
    In many ways, our memories make us who we are, helping us remember our past, learn and retain skills, and plan for the future.  
  * [But, what is Virtual Memory?](https://youtu.be/A9WLYbE0p-I?si=q9eg9XPuIxWmAqez)  
    Let's dive into the world of virtual memory, a common memory management technique used in operating systems.
  * [Chaching Overview](https://aws.amazon.com/id/caching/)
    Why does our browser consume pretty much memory but once we restart it, its memory consumption decrease? The reason behind it is caching. Some of our programs are designed to be able to caching. Why do we need it? Caching is quite important to speed up running time since the data are stored in cache (top layer memory), so that we do not have to access lower layer memory such as hard drive and solid state drive.
  * [Cache Memory in Computer Organization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cache-memory-in-computer-organization/)
    Cache Memory is a small memory that is temporary. The data or contents of the main memory that are used frequently by CPU are stored in the cache memory so that the processor can easily access that data in a shorter time. Whenever the CPU needs to access memory, it first checks the cache memory. If the data is not found in cache memory, CPU will move into the main memory. On this website will be discussed about the memory level, type, performance, and mapping of the cache.

  * [The fork() function in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/)
    The fork system call is one of the important topics that you should know in the Operating system subject. Fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call (parent process). Visit this page to read more explanations about fork() in C.
  * [The fork() function in C : Youtube](https://youtu.be/cex9XrZCU14?si=m-ri2fcn3MPm1eJs)
  * [All You Need To Know About Processes in Linux [Comprehensive Guide] (3â€™ Article)](https://www.tecmint.com/linux-process-management/)
    A process refers to a program in execution; itâ€™s a running instance of a program. A new process is normally created when an existing process makes an exact copy of itself in memory. The child process will have the same environment as its parent ðŸ¤¼, but only the process ID number is different. Init process is the mother (parent) of all processes on the system, itâ€™s the first program that is executed when the Linux system boots up; it manages all other processes on the system. It is started by the kernel itself, so in principle it does not have a parent process.

  * [Process Synchronization in Operating System](https://my.eng.utah.edu/~cs5460/slides/Lecture07.pdf)
    Basic ideas behind most synchronization: If two threads, processes, interrupt handlers, etc. are going to have conflicting accesses, force one of them to wait until it is safe to proceed. Synchronization problems are: (1) synchronization can be required for different resources (2) there are different kinds of synchronization problems (3) synchronization may be across machines (4) sometimes itâ€™s not OK to block a thread or process.
  * [Process Synchronization : Youtube](https://youtu.be/ph2awKa8r5Y?si=AycmJDf4mMhIfNft)
  * [Semaphore : Youtube](https://youtu.be/XDIOC2EY5JE?si=etm3hL0p46D8wT4r)
  * [Difference Between Mutex and Semaphore](https://afteracademy.com/blog/difference-between-mutex-and-semaphore-in-operating-system/)
    Mutex is a mutual exclusion object that allows access to a resource to be synchronized. At the start of a program, it is given a unique name. And then a semaphore is a signaling mechanism. By reading this website youâ€™ll get to understand the difference between mutex and semaphore. They also use an example thatâ€™s very easy to use so that we can understand more about mutex and semaphore.

  * [LFS 12.2 - How to build Linux From Scratch 12.2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyc5xVO2uDsDzdT8lkx430hZ-gY69wgS3)
    In this series of videos I demonstrate how to install LFS 12.2 on real hardware with an empty disk. If you've never built Linux From Scratch before, don't worry as I go through the LFS book chapter-by-chapter. From disk configuration, fetching sources and compiling, right through to configuring and booting the final operating system, it's all recorded in these videos. The end result is a fully working Linux From Scratch system all built from publicly available open source code using the excellent instructions in the Linux From Scratch 12.2 book.
  * [CPU Scheduling in Operating Systems ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)
    A typical process involves both I/O time and CPU time. In a uni programming system like MS-DOS, time spent waiting for I/O is wasted and the CPU is free during this time. In multiprogramming systems, one process can use a CPU while another is waiting for I/O. This is possible only with process scheduling.
  * [Deadline scheduler in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadline-scheduler-in-operating-system/)
    Deadline Scheduler is n I/O scheduler for the Linux kernel and guarantees a start service time for a request. Deadline Scheduler imposes deadlines on all I/O operations in order to prevent wanted requests. Two deadlines read and write queues (basically sorted by their deadline) are maintained. For every new request, the scheduler selects which queue will serve for it. Read queues are given high priority than write queues because during reading operations the processes usually get blocked.
